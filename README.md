# Feelings About Universities

# Descripition 

The project will consider people’s comments about the Universities on the Internet. According to the information in the comments, the program will be able to choose which university is good about something or which university is bad about something.

# Proposal

I am planning to arrange how the people are thinking about the universities on the Internet http://www.twitter.com by comparing the comments about universities. I’m going to use Twitter API for collecting data for a certain user. Then I’m going to try to extract some information from that data by using simple and effective techniques. For instance, “Muğla university is good” or “I don't like ODTÜ”.
